## I [did poorly] as an educator

- R Class for workforce training
- RStudio was overwhelming for a learner
- They quit the course

# What could have made the experience better?

## Introducing WebR/Pyodide

::::{.panel-tabset group="language"}

## R
```{webr}
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("data/cereal.csv")
summary(data)
```

## Python
```{pyodide}
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("data/cereal.csv")
data.info()
```

## WebR/Pyodide can Help

- Lower cognitive load 
- Encourage active learning 
- Increase social learning 

# Lower Cognitive Load

## Thoughts in a Learner's Brain 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
- What is R actually?
- Variable? What's that?
- Need to finish that report...
- Got to pick up my daughter in an hour
- Am I doing this right?
- RStudio? OMG, I don't get it
:::
:::{.column #vcenter}
:::{.fragment}
**This is all cognitive load**

## Fear is Part of Cognitive Load

> ~~Am I Doing this Right?~~

- Fear of doing something wrong
- Everything we can do to alleviate fear, the less cognitive load learners will have.

## RStudio / Positron Overwhelm {.nonincremental}

## Lower Friction for New Learners

- Imagine you are brand new to working with programming
- Feedback is important 

## Exercise {.smaller}

+ Filter `penguins` so that it only shows penguins from the `island` of `Biscoe` (you'll have to use the `island` variable). Assign it to `biscoe_penguins`.

:::{.fragment}
```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_3
#add your filter statement here
biscoe_penguins <- filter(penguins, island == "________")

#show number of crime movies
nrow(biscoe_penguins)
```

::: { .solution exercise="ex_3"}
::: { .callout-tip collapse=false}

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_3
#| solution: true
#add your filter statement here
biscoe_penguins <- filter(penguins, island == "Biscoe")

#show number of crime movies
nrow(biscoe_penguins)
```

## What's Next?

- [x] Follow up with session on RStudio / Positron / VSCode
- [x] Have them work in Quarto on Posit.cloud
- [x] Use WebR/Pyodide for in-class exercises

# Increase Active Learning 

## What is Active Learning?

- Learning by doing
- Activities that cement knowledge by application
    - Meta-learning

## Model Meta-learning

- Learning how to learn
- Help learners explore documentation

## Exercise (R) {.smaller}

- Look at the [documentation for `arrange()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html). Take a look at the examples.

- How do we change the below code to sort by descending order?


:::{.fragment}
```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
#| setup: true
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins <- penguins[1:6,]
library(dplyr)
```

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
penguins |>
    arrange(body_mass_g)
```

::: {.solution exercise="ex_2"}
#### Solution

Use the `desc()` function.

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
#| solution: true
penguins |>
    arrange(desc(body_mass_g))
```
:::

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
#| check: true
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

## Active Learning

- WebR/Pyodide is excellent at this
- Use as part of lessons

# Increase Social Learning

## What is Social Learning?

- Learning is a cognitive process with social context
- We learn better when we learn together
- Discussion with your neighbor 

## WebR/Pyodide for Social Learning {.incremental}

- Paired programming exercises
- Make your own design decisions
	- Better Tables
- Share packages for demos
    - Data Snacks

## [Better Plots](https://better-plots.netlify.app/) {.incremental}

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
- Take a Paper Doll approach to improving plots
- Design in in the eye of the beholder
    - Discuss what works for you
- Sharing styling code with each other

## Better Plots {.smaller}

Experiment with adding or removing to the graph, adding your own annotations.

If there's a show that you want to highlight, try adding an annotation to highlight it. Or try adding an annotation at Roseanne's lowest rating!

::::{.panel-tabset group="language"}
## R

```{webr}
my_plot + 
    labs(title = "Is it better to burn out than fade away?",
         x="Season Number", y="Average Rating") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5, lty=3) +
 # annotate(geom="text", x = 7, y=8.5, 
 #         label = "The Walking\n Dead (brainzzz)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:10))
```

## Python

```{pyodide}
my_plot = sns.lineplot(data=tv_shows,
                 x="seasonNumber",
                 y="av_rating",
                 hue="title")

#my_plot.set_title("Is it better to burn out than fade away?", fontsize=20)
#my_plot.set_xlabel ("Season Number", fontsize=15)
#my_plot.set_ylabel ("Average Rating", fontsize=15)
#my_plot.set_xticks(range(1,11))
#plt.axhline(y=7.8, linestyle="--")
#plt.text(x=7, y=8.5, s="The Walking\n Dead (brainzzz)")
plt.show()
```

## [Data Snacks](https://hutchdatascience.org/data_snacks/)

![](datasnack.jpg)

## Note: Summative Assessment

- Using WebR/Pyodide for summative assessment is difficult
	- Technically difficult 
		- client side / source code is available in console
	- Come talk to George if you want to do this


## Conclusion

WebR/Pyodide is a powerful technology that can help you to:

- Reduce Cognitive Load
- Increase Active Learning
- Increase Social Learning
